# self-consistent-expression-recovery-machine (SERM)
SERM is a data-driven gene expression recovery framework. Using deep learning, SERM first learns from a subset of the noisy gene expression data to estimate the underlying data distribution. SERM then recovers the overall gene expression data by analytically imposing a self- consistency on the gene expression matrix, thus ensuring that the expression levels are similarly distributed in different parts of the matrix.

# How to use SERM?
The gene expression data should be in matrix format (rows are cells and collumns are genes). There are a few parameters: 1) ROI length and width: SERM divides the whole matrix into a number of ROIs. The user can choose the size of the ROI that would be used by SERM. 2) Percent overlap: This parameter dictates how much overlap will be between two consecutive ROIs. The user can choose any value between 0.01 to 0.99. However, for small overlap, the consecutive windows would be disconnected and for large window size, more computation will be necessary. A value between 0.25 or 0.75 works well with SERM. 

# About parameter settings:
SERM works well for a large range of parameters. Thus, even without careful settings, it provides much better results than traditional techniques.
