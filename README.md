# self-consistent-expression-recovery-machine (SERM)
SERM is a data-driven gene expression recovery framework. Using deep learning, SERM first learns from a subset of the noisy gene expression data to estimate the underlying data distribution. Using this estimation, SERM then recovers the overall gene expression data by analytically imposing a self- consistency on the gene expression matrix, thus ensuring that the expression levels are similarly distributed in different parts of the matrix.
